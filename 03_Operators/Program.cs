// Arithmetic Operators (Math)

//C# has five main categories that encompass its operators


int additionResult = 5 + 2; //+ is our addition operator
Console.WriteLine ("5 + 2 = " + additionResult);

// Subtraction
int subtractionResult = 5-2;
Console.WriteLine("5 - 2 = " + subtractionResult);

// Multiplication
int multiplicationResult = 5 * 2;
Console.WriteLine ("5 * 2 =" + multiplicationResult);

// Division (the answer is 2 because using an int which looses the additional information)
int divisionResult = 5 / 2;
Console.WriteLine ("5 / 2 =" + divisionResult);

//The double will show remainder as long as the the variable  represents a double
double doubleResult = 5.0 / 2;
Console.WriteLine (" 5 / 2 = " + doubleResult);

// Modulus(remainder)
int modulusResult = 5 % 2;
Console.WriteLine ( "5 % 2 = " + modulusResult);
