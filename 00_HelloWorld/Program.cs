// c# is a compiled language
// javascript is interpreted

// Before running c#, we must first BUILD and COMPILE it (dotnet build in terminal to build our project) then 
//dotnet run --project 00_HelloWorld (after doing this, will be able to see the "Hello, World!" console statement in terminal)

//dotnet watch run --project 00_HelloWorld
//dotnet watch provides a hot reload
//This runs the application after changes are saved (sort of like liveserver, will allow us to run the code without rerunning commands over)

// ctrl + c to stop dotnet watch

//gitignore- specifies intentionally untracked filled to ignore
